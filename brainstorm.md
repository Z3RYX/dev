Centralized Coin

limit:          1,000,000,000 coins
distribution:   10,000 coins every 30 minutes split between all wallets
tax:            every day 5% of every wallet will get collected, 1% of it will be burned, the rest will be redistributed

tax example:
    10000 coins * 5% = 500 coins
    500 coins * 1% = 5 coins to be burned (min. 1 coin)
    495 coins will be added to a pool and then redistributed among all wallets

    2 wallets = [10000, 5000] each give 500 & 250
    burns 8 coins
    adds 742 to the pool
    742 coins / 2 = each wallet gets 371 coins
